generator testing library and front-end, which was written by Robert G. Brown.

The bevarage clause mentioned is 

   License is granted to build or use the accompanying software:

                             dieharder

  according to the following standard Gnu General Public License or any
  later versions, with the one minor "Beverage" modification listed below.
  Note that this modification is probably not legally defensible and can
  be followed really pretty much according to the honor rule.

  As to my personal preferences in beverages, red wine is great, beer is
  delightful, and Coca Cola or coffee or tea or even milk acceptable to
  those who for religious or personal reasons wish to avoid stressing my
  liver.

                  The "Beverage" Modification to the GPL

  Any user of this software shall, upon meeting the primary author(s) of
  this software for the first time under the appropriate circumstances,
  offer to buy him or her or them a beverage.  This beverage may or may
  not be alcoholic, depending on the personal ethical and moral views of
  the offerer.  The beverage cost need not exceed one U.S. dollar
  (although it certainly may at the whim of the offerer:-) and may be
  accepted or declined with no further obligation on the part of the
  offerer.  It is not necessary to repeat the offer after the first
  meeting, but it can't hurt...

which is followed by the text of the GNU GPL, Version 2, June 1991


Regarding intellectual / academic acknowledgements, let alone
copyrights, Robert G. Brown writes the following the README:

-- snip ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dieharder is original code written by and Copyright Robert G. Brown
(with different code modules written over the period 2003-present).  The
tests included (or expected to be included in the future) in dieharder,
are, however, derived from descriptions from several places.

  * Diehard, a famous suite of random number tests written over many
years by George Marsaglia.  The original Diehard sources (written in
Fortran) are (of course) Copyright George Marsaglia according to the
Berne convention, where authors retain copyright with or without a
notice in any original work.  The original Diehard code written by
Marsaglia did not include a copyright notice or an explicit license in
or with the sources that have been made publically available on the web
for many years.  When contacted, Dr. Marsaglia has indicated his wish to
restrict commercial usage of his code and permit only academic/research
related use.  For this reason the the algorithms are fully
re-implemented, in original code, in dieharder to keep authorship and
GPL licensing issues clear.  However, all diehard-equivalent tests are
clearly labelled as such and academically attributed to Dr. Marsaglia.

  * The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Statistical Test Suite (STS) as described in publication SP800-22b.
Although this test suite was developed with government support and is
explicitly in the public domain, and is available in C source.  There is
some overlap between STS and Diehard -- for example, both have binary
matrix rank tests -- but the STS focusses primarily on bitlevel
randomness and the suitability of a random number generator for use in
cryptographic applications.  The tests described in SP800-22b that are
implemented in dieharder are completely rewritten in original C by
Robert G. Brown to keep copyright and GPL issues clear.  All STS-derived
tests are clearly labelled as such and are academically attributed to
the various authors of the suite (Andrew Rukhin, Juan Soto, James
Nechvatal, Miles Smid, Elaine Barker, Stefan Leigh, Mark Levenson, Mark
Vangel, David Banks, Alan Heckert, James Dray, San Vo).

  * Original tests or timing operations inserted by Robert G. Brown.
Almost any distribution that can be computed on the basis of a source of
random numbers with a derived statistic with known or reliably
measurable statistical properties can serve as a test of random numbers
using the general approach implemented in Diehard, the STS, Dieharder,
and elsewhere.

  * Tests described in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming.

  * User-contributed tests.

  * Tests described elsewhere in the literature.

In all cases some effort has been made to correctly attribute the
originator of a test algorithm, and if there are any errors in this
regard they will be happily corrected once they are brought to the
attention of the author.
